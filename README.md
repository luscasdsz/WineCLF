Using a kaggle dataset, the model uses multiple chemical features to discover if a wine is either Red or White, i am using support vector machines and cv. Also used Pipeline 

üç∑ Wine Type Classification with SVM

Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to classify wines as red or white using physicochemical properties.
The model is built using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel and standardized features.
